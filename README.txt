This GitHub repository was made for the submission to the University of Copenhagen titled: "Mapping Ethics and Sustainability in the Field of Artificial Intelligence in Norway: Hyperlink network analysis informed by ethnographic fieldwork."

This thesis examines the landscape in Norway within artificial intelligence and sustainability based on a hyperlink network analysis of actors derived from ethnographic fieldwork. It is an exploratory examination of how actors working within the AI domain in Norway converge and form networks around sustainability issues and challenges. It is a preliminary investigation of how ‘sustainability’ and ‘ethics’ are discussed in the field of artificial intelligence, both online and in various local contexts.

A central part of this exploration has been the construction of a hyperlink network – and this has been visualised in the following file.

The InteractiveVis project of the Oxford Internet Institute with funding by JISC aims to allow easy creation of interactive visualisations for geospatial and network data using native web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and SVG) and allow these visualisations to be self-contained so that they may run entirely offline in ebooks and other media. The project will survey existing solutions and build the necessary components to fill in missing features and smooth over incompatibilities in between existing libraries. The project will further provide online hosted wizards to allow for the easy creation of these interactive visualizations.
